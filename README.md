# Loan Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis task performed on a loan dataset. Using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore key features in the dataset and analyze patterns in categorical and numerical data.

## Project Structure

The code performs the following steps:
1. **Data Import**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Exploration**:
   - Displaying column names and the first few rows.
   - Visualizing categorical variables in relation to `Loan_Status`.
3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculating and displaying key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for `ApplicantIncome`.
4. **Distribution Analysis**:
   - Generating a histogram to observe the distribution of `ApplicantIncome`.
5. **Marital Status Analysis**:
   - Counting and visualizing the distribution of married and unmarried applicants.

## Libraries Used

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and loading.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For generating plots.
- `seaborn`: For advanced plotting and data visualization.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
